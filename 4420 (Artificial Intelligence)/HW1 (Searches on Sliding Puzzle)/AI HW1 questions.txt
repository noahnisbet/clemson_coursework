A)	In the program

B)	In the program

C)	In the program

D)	In the program

E)	In the program. It took 1756 steps to find the solution. The solution was only 12 moves 
	long.

F)	A depth-first search took many more steps to find the solution. The depth first search 
	took 120621 steps to find. The solution is 59038 moves long. This is because the depth-
	first search is not optimal. It is pretty much just luck to find the goal state early in the 
	search with DFS. On the other hand, BFS is not just luck. If the algorithm takes fewer 
	steps, it is because the goal state is a low number of actions away from the start.

G)	In the program. It took 61406 steps to find the goal. The solution is 53292 moves long.

H)	I used the state 125387064 for my analysis.
 
	a.	It took 615 steps from the algorithm to find the goal state. The goal state was 11 
		actions away from the start.

	b.	It took 759 steps from the algorithm to find the goal state. The goal state was 11 
		actions away from the start. It took fewer steps for the unit cost UCS because 
		there is no reason to have these costs associated with moves. It will just throw 
		off the algorithm. If there were some reasons for these heuristics, maybe it 
		would help. It happens to not change the length of the goal sequence in this 
		case, however, there is no reason for it to be the same. It could lengthen the 
		goal sequence as well.
